/**
 * Created by Max on 3/9/2016.
 *
 * The PlayScreen class will be responsible for showing the dungeon and all it's inhabitants and loot â€” but since we
 * don't have that yet we'll just tell the player how much fun he's having. It will also respond to user input by
 * moving the player and either setting us in "win" mode if we won the game, or "lose" mode if we lost.
 *
 * For additional screens the player will interact with while playing, we'll have the PlayScreen know if we're working
 * with a sub screen and delegate input and output to it. Once the subscreen is done, it get's set to null and the
 * PlayScreen works as normal.
 *
 * The PlayScreen is getting a little out of hand now that it creates a new world, displays the world, handles user
 * commands and deals with subscreens. Maybe the part about setting up a new game should be moved somewhere else.
 * ToDo: Move game setup out of PlayScreen.
