/**
 * Created by Max on 3/19/2016.
 *
 * Since we've got a world with items in it, we need to be able to pick them up and do stuff with them. A lot can
 * happen with a creature's inventory so it gets a dedicated class. Instead of using a list we'll use an array so the
 * items index doesn't change when we lose something before it. E.g. if we quaff the potion in our 'd' slot, whatever
 * was in the 'e' slot should remain there and not slide into the 'd' slot. If you want that kind of behavior then you
 * could use a List â€” but we don't.
