/**
 * Created by Max on 3/9/2016.
 *
 * Roguelikes happen somewhere. A somewhere made of floors, walls, rivers, trees, caves, doors, or whatever you can
 * imagine.
 *
 * Each Tile needs to be displayed so we need a glyph to display and a color to display it with. Since we only have a
 * few different tile types, and all tiles of the same type look and behave the same, we can represent the tiles as a
 * java enum.
 *
 * TODO: Tweak Enums to public final member fields.
 * Comment from Trystan's blog... I think that with an enum like your tile enum, you should use public final member
 * fields, and skip the accessor methods. The types of the fields themselves are immutable, so the enum will still be
 * immutable as a whole.
 *
 * TODO: Add more tile types.
 * Just add them to the Tile enum like the floor and wall then add it to the WorldBuilder somewhere. Maybe call an
 * addRivers method or addTree method after the makeCaves method.

     * It's often useful to have another kind of tile that represents out of bounds. That way instead of always
     * checking if something is out of bounds before checking the map about a specific tile, we can just ask and the map
     * and it can tell us it's out of bounds and we can handle that however we want. If you're familiar with the
     * NullObject design pattern then it's very similar; I guess you could call it an OutOfBoundsObject.
